# 🎵 Predicting Song Success Using Lyrics and Audio Features

This project explores whether it's possible to predict the success of a song based on its lyrics and audio features using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques.

## 📌 Project Objective

The goal is to develop a model that can accurately predict the success of a song using:

- Lyrics scraped from [Genius](https://genius.com/)
- Audio characteristics such as danceability, energy, and tempo

## 📂 Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading & Preprocessing**  
   - Import datasets with lyrics and audio features  
   - Clean and prepare the text and numerical data  
   - Handle missing values  
   - Engineer features relevant for model training  

2. **NLP Techniques**  
   - Sentiment analysis to detect lyrical tone  
   - Topic modeling to uncover common themes  
   - Keyword extraction and frequency analysis  

3. **Machine Learning Modeling**  
   - Train multiple models on the preprocessed dataset  
   - Evaluate and compare performance  
   - Identify the best model for song success prediction  

4. **Analysis & Insights**  
   - Examine the relationship between lyrical content and popularity  
   - Explore the impact of explicit lyrics on success  
   - Provide actionable insights for the music industry

## 🧪 Technologies Used

- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib)
- NLP (NLTK, spaCy or similar)
- Machine Learning (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Jupyter Notebooks

## 📊 Key Ideas Explored

- Can the tone or sentiment of lyrics predict song success?
- What are the most common lyrical themes in successful songs?
- Do explicit lyrics influence a song's popularity?

## 🧠 Potential Applications

- Support A&R teams in identifying likely hit songs
- Provide analytics tools for songwriters and producers
- Inform content recommendations in streaming platforms
